            "I am a Software Engineer and Developer, graduating soon from Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo (INTEC) in April 2026.",
            "I am passionate about building digital products that don’t just “work”, but feel clear, solid, and enjoyable to use. That’s why I place strong emphasis on quality, attention to detail, and a modern user experience.",
            "My approach starts with understanding business logic: I analyze the problem, identify opportunities for improvement, and design efficient and scalable solutions. I have participated in projects covering the full software development lifecycle—from analysis and design to testing and implementation—and I stand out for clear technical documentation and a quality-focused mindset.",
            "On the technical side, I work with mobile development using Flutter (Dart), web development with React, and databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. I rely on best practices, version control with Git/GitHub, testing and integration, and Agile/Scrum methodologies, applying a CI/CD mindset whenever the context requires it.",
            "Among my projects, FinClarity stands out—a Flutter-based personal finance app featuring visual analytics and budgeting, built with a local database and a modular architecture. I have also developed MercaVerde, a B2C/B2B Flutter marketplace focused on reducing food waste, integrating a Supabase backend, PostgreSQL, secure payments, and real-time geolocation.",
            "On a personal level, I am a cooperative and results-driven professional. I enjoy working in teams, recognizing strengths, and adding structure so ideas can be transformed into real deliverables. This combination of analytical thinking, attention to detail, and product-oriented mindset guides everything I design, build, and deliver."
